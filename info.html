        Dr. Nicolás Araneda Hinrichs works within cognitive neuroscience of language and is currently a visiting scholar at de Institute for Applied Linguistics and Translatology of de Universität Leipzig, where he is pursuing his Habilitation (the institute's director, Prof. Oliver Czuulo, is his current advisor); for this purpose he just founded a research group with Dr. Maryam Foradi to carry out an agenda that combines neurocognitive experiments with computational corpus linguistics on the basis of both primes from Wierzbicka´s Natural Semantic Metalanguage frames from the FrameNet initiative.

Stemming from biological anthropology, he borrows its cultural perspective and ethnographic stance in order to also critically work across the cognitive niche through the questioning of its epistemic and ontic roots as emerging from discursive practices and global mode of knowledge production. This endeavour will come forth in a series of publications redacted with fellow peers. The first one was single-authored and released mid-September 2020 as a research article in a Special Issue of the Journal Frontiers in Neuroscience titled "(New) Realist Social Cognition".
